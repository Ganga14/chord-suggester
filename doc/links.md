## Using MAC 

(to improve my pessimal productivity using Mac as a old Window user...)

* [iTerm2 + zsh + oh-my-zsh The Most Power Full Terminal on macOS](https://medium.com/ayuth/iterm2-zsh-oh-my-zsh-the-most-power-full-of-terminal-on-macos-bdb2823fb04c). Some vitamins for your Mac Terminal.

## Music Libraries

* [Plugins for chords detection](https://musescore.org/en/node/263921)
* [Several music libraries](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonInMusic)
* [PyChoReLib](http://chordrecognizer.sourceforge.net/) - Python Chord Recognition Library. This is a library that implements the transformation from a list of notenames to a chord name. The system can be taught new chords by example: tell it that ['c', 'e', 'g'] is called a 'C' chord, and using its built-in music knowledge it immediately recognizes all major triads in all keys and all inversions/permutations. Comes with a real-time midi-input demo program (needs PyPortMidi).
