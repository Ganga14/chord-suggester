# Brainstorming

No-sense ideas...

What if we extract chords for modern music just getting from chord pages instead of midi files?

Use chord live detection project (fropm KSchool) to listen to a guitar, detect chords and suggest next. 

I should explain why I decided to change the strategy from midi processing to scraping. 

I should explain msuc conceps using music21, with sheets and music examples:
* Notes.
* Chords.
* Notas extrañas 
....

If I could represent the chords as vector, It would be easier and faster to train
